## Note on Availability

The availability of crayfish, especially the local "Berlin lobster" variety, can be inconsistent due to the nature of catching an invasive species. It's recommended to call ahead and check availability before visiting these locations.

## Sustainable Harvesting

It's important to note that while crayfish are invasive and their removal is encouraged, harvesting should be done responsibly and in accordance with local regulations. Always ensure that you're purchasing from licensed sources or fishing with proper permits.

## Seasonal Considerations

Crayfish are typically most abundant in Berlin's waters during the warmer months, from late spring through early fall. This is when you're most likely to find fresh, locally caught crayfish at markets and restaurants.


## Berlin-Style Crayfish Boil Recipe (Serves 50)

### Ingredients:

- 50-60 kg live crayfish (approximately 1-1.2 kg per person)
- 10 kg small red potatoes, halved 
- 20 ears of corn, cut into thirds
- 5 kg smoked sausage (e.g. kielbasa), cut into 5 cm pieces
- 5 kg onions, quartered
- 10 heads of garlic, halved crosswise
- 10 lemons, halved
- 500 g butter, melted (for serving)

### For the boil:

- 4-5 large pots (60-80 liter capacity each)
- 4-5 propane burners 
- 500 g salt
- 250 g Old Bay seasoning 
- 100 g cayenne pepper
- 10 bay leaves
- 5 bottles (330 ml each) German dark beer

### Instructions:

1. Fill each pot 2/3 full with water. Add proportional amounts of salt, Old Bay, cayenne, bay leaves, and beer to each pot. Bring to a boil.

2. Add potatoes and cook for 10 minutes.

3. Add corn, sausage, onions, garlic, and lemons. Cook for another 5 minutes.

4. Add crayfish and cook for 3-5 minutes until bright red. 

5. Remove from heat and let soak for 15-20 minutes to absorb flavors.

6. Drain and serve on newspaper-covered tables with melted butter for dipping.

### Notes:

- Adjust spices to taste. Berlin palates may prefer less heat than traditional Southern recipes.
- Serve with cold German beer and plenty of napkins.
- Consider including local touches like pretzels or sauerkraut as sides.

Remember to source crayfish responsibly, following local regulations for harvesting invasive species. Enjoy your Berlin-style crayfish boil!
