Analysis

1. Average Weight Loss per Day:

To calculate the average weight loss per day, we'll use the following formula:
(Initial Weight - Final Weight) / Days to Cut

Calculating for each piece (excluding A8 due to missing data):

- A1: (694 - 293) / 23 = 17.43 g/day
- A2: (656 - 304) / 20 = 17.60 g/day
- A3: (640 - 275) / 21 = 17.38 g/day
- A4: (623 - 242) / 29 = 13.14 g/day
- A5: (533 - 220) / 29 = 10.79 g/day
- A6: (515 - 235) / 24 = 11.67 g/day
- A7: (552 - 248) / 15 = 20.27 g/day
- A9: (248 - 125) / 9 = 13.67 g/day
- A10: (110 - 65) / 4 = 11.25 g/day
- A11: (140 - 84) / 6 = 9.33 g/day
- A12: (205 - 102) / 13 = 7.92 g/day
- A13: (362 - 215) / 13 = 11.31 g/day
- A14: (312 - 146) / 17 = 9.76 g/day
- A15: (202 - 99) / 6 = 17.17 g/day

Total weight loss per day: 188.69 g
Number of pieces: 14

Average weight loss per day across all pieces: 188.69 / 14 = 13.48 g/day

The average weight loss per day for this batch of biltong is approximately 13.48 grams.

2. Average Daily Weight Loss Based on Initial Weight:

To determine the average daily weight loss rate based on initial weight, we'll calculate the percentage of initial weight lost per day for each piece:

- A1: (17.43 / 694) * 100 = 2.51% per day
- A2: (17.60 / 656) * 100 = 2.68% per day
- A3: (17.38 / 640) * 100 = 2.72% per day
- A4: (13.14 / 623) * 100 = 2.11% per day
- A5: (10.79 / 533) * 100 = 2.02% per day
- A6: (11.67 / 515) * 100 = 2.27% per day
- A7: (20.27 / 552) * 100 = 3.67% per day
- A9: (13.67 / 248) * 100 = 5.51% per day
- A10: (11.25 / 110) * 100 = 10.23% per day
- A11: (9.33 / 140) * 100 = 6.67% per day
- A12: (7.92 / 205) * 100 = 3.86% per day
- A13: (11.31 / 362) * 100 = 3.12% per day
- A14: (9.76 / 312) * 100 = 3.13% per day
- A15: (17.17 / 202) * 100 = 8.50% per day

Average percentage loss per day: 4.21%

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that on average, biltong loses approximately 4.21% of its initial weight per day. However, it's important to note that this rate is not linear and varies significantly based on the initial weight of the piece.

For a more accurate representation, we can provide a formula that takes into account the non-linear nature of the weight loss:

Daily Weight Loss (g) = 0.0421 * Initial Weight (g)

This formula suggests that for every 100g of initial weight, approximately 4.21g is lost per day. However, keep in mind that this is a simplified model and actual weight loss can vary based on factors such as thickness of the meat, ambient humidity, and air circulation.
