# Biltong batch 5

8.2 KG Silverside Irish Beef — Gourmet Experts €216.61

## Main notes

- Need to increase wash by 30%
- Temperature of meat affects how long the wash is useable due to the fat & myoglobin mixing.
- Finer the spice grind, the more you need, I would prefer to increase the seasoning volume by 40% 
- The meat remained spiced in the fridge for 2 evenings, given that its functionally a dry brine, I should actually weight sections before placing in the fridge next time.


## Wash ingredients

- 70 g Worcestershire sauce (adjusted from 99.4 g - used available amount)
- 27.8 g red-wine vinegar
- 22.5 g apple-cider vinegar
- 26.5 g condimento blanco
- 21.2 g black-malt vinegar

Calculated spices for fifth batch (as actually used)

- 110.5 g salt (-10% from base)
- 13.9 g black pepper
- 47.3 g coriander (coarse-ground)
- 9–10 star-anise pods
- 54 g garam masala (4 g original + 50 g supplement for tandoori shortage)
- 50 g tandoori masala (reduced from 107.4 g - used available amount)
- 50 g direct-from-India masala (new addition)
- 5 chipotle + 3 guajillo chilies
- 80 g piment d'Espelette (French chili powder - substituted for cayenne)
- 15 g cayenne pepper powder (omitted - forgot to purchase)

### Batch 5 Substitution Notes:

**Worcestershire**: Used 70g instead of calculated 99.4g

**Tandoori masala**: Limited to 50g available, compensated with extra garam masala

**Garam masala**: Increased to 54g total (original 4g + 50g supplement)

**Chili powder**: Switched to 80g piment d'Espelette (French) instead of 15g cayenne

**Weight**: Actual silverside was 8.2kg with larger loins resulting in fewer individual sections
