# Pickled Jalapeños Recipe

## Ingredients

- 500g fresh jalapeño peppers, sliced into rings (approximately 15-20 medium-sized jalapeños)
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
- 2 cups white distilled vinegar
- 2 cups water
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 1 bay leaf

## Instructions

1. Wash the jalapeños and slice them into rings about 1/4 inch thick. Discard the stems.

2. In a medium saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, peppercorns, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar and salt dissolve.

3. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, pack the sliced jalapeños and garlic cloves into clean glass jars.

5. Carefully pour the hot brine over the jalapeños, making sure they are completely covered.

6. Allow the jars to cool to room temperature.

7. Seal the jars and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before eating to allow the flavors to develop.

## Storage

These pickled jalapeños will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.

## Notes

- For a milder flavor, remove the seeds from the jalapeños before slicing.
- Adjust the sugar to taste: more sugar will result in a milder pickle, less will keep them spicier.
- You can add other spices like cumin seeds or coriander seeds for variation.

## Potential Modifications

For those looking to experiment, here are some novel additions you can try:

1. Add 2½ teaspoons of sesame oil to the brine for a unique flavor profile.
2. Include cauliflower florets and green beans for extra color and variety.
3. Add jicama sticks for additional crunch and mild flavor.
4. Replace the water in the brine with white wine for added depth.
5. Experiment with spices like cumin and chili powder in the brine.
6. Try adding broccoli florets for extra texture and nutritional value.
7. Use coconut sugar instead of regular sugar for a less refined option.

Remember to adjust the brine quantities if adding extra vegetables to ensure everything is properly covered.
